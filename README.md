# UBMO
Urban and Building Multiscale Ontology 
Abstract
Considering extending building checking in order to take into account urban regulations and contexts necessitates aligning the different urban elements such as buildings, bridges, roads, environment, etc. Such alignments mainly apply to the domains of BIM (Building Information Model) and GIS (Geographic Information System). We are aiming for semantic interoperability between both domains while keeping them independent. In our previous publication (Roxin & Hbeich, 2019), we have specified interoperability issues between BIM and GIS models, presented existing approaches that tried to achieve interoperability among them, and finally proposed our approach: horizontal and vertical federation. In this article, we are further describing our approach for horizontal federation that is a) the Urban and Building Multiscale Ontology (UBMO) and b) the alignments defined to concepts and properties present in existing ontologies. The UBMO ontology serves as a reference vocabulary for urban regulations checking. Its elements are semantically linked to several existing ontologies for French administration (e.g., IGN administrative ontology, INSEE geographic ontology), urban elements, infrastructures, and buildings (GeoNames ontology, Start-DT ontology, CityGML ontology, Icity ontology, BOT, IfcOWL, SIMMODEL, etc.)
